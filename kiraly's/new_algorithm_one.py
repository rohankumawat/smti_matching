"""
While there exists an active man m, he proposes to his favorite woman w.
- if w accepts his proposal, they become engaged.
- if w rejects his proposal, m deltes w from his list.

When a woman w gets a new proposal from man m
- she always accepts this proposal if she is a "maiden" or a "flighty" woman".
- she also accepts this proposal, if she prefers m to her current fiance. 
- otherwise, she rejects m.

If w accepted m, then she rejects her previous fiance,
- if there was one(breaks off her engagement), and becomes engaged to m.

If m was engaged to a woman w and later w rejects him, 
- then m becomes active again, and deletes w from his list,
- except if m is uncertain, in this case m keeps w on the list.

If the list of m becomes empty for the first time, 
- he turns into a bachelor, 
- his original list is recovered,
- and he reactivates himself.

If the list of m becomes empty for the second time, 
- he will turn into an old bachelor and will remain inactive forever.
